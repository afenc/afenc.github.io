BACKGROUND:
Clinical trials have investigated efficacy of drug-eluting balloon (DEB) angioplasty for bare-metal stent (BMS) in-stent restenosis (ISR). Few studies have investigated predictors of long-term outcomes following BMS-ISR treatment with DEB.

METHODS:
From June 2011 to April 2015, 105 patients with 125 BMS-ISR lesions were enrolled from the Cardiovascular Atherosclerosis and Percutaneous TrAnsluminal INterventions (CAPTAIN) registry. All these lesions were treated with DEB angioplasty as final therapy. The major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) were recurrent clinically driven target lesion revascularisation (TLR), myocardial infarction, and cardiac death after DEB angioplasty.

RESULTS:
After DEB angioplasty, the angiographic stenosis decreased from 84.8%±12.4% to 22.6%±10.4%. Over a mean follow-up duration of 21.7±13.4months, the rates of TLR at 1-12 months and 12-48 months were 4.8% and 4.2%, respectively. The rates of MACEs at 1-12 months and 12-48 months were 6.7% and 6.1%, respectively. Chronic haemodialysis, calcified lesion, chronic total occlusion lesion before stenting, stent with metal-to-artery ratio >16.5%, and residual stenosis >25% after DEB angioplasty were potential risk factors for MACEs in univariate analysis. After adjustment in multivariate analysis, independent predictors of long-term MACEs were identified as chronic haemodialysis, chronic total occlusion lesion before stenting, and residual stenosis >25% after DEB angioplasty.

CONCLUSIONS:
The long-term results of DEB angioplasty for BMS-ISR are acceptable in this real-world registry. Patient (chronic haemodialysis), lesion (chronic total occlusion) and angioplasty (residual stenosis percentage) related factors predicted long-term outcomes following BMS-ISR treatment with DEB angioplasty.

Abstract
It is not understood if dabigatran or rivaroxaban are superior to antiplatelet agents (AA) for safety outcomes in Asians with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). In this study we evaluated the bleeding risk of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, warfarin and AA in Asians with NVAF. This national retrospective cohort study analyzed 6,600, 3,167, 5,338 and 8,238 consecutive NVAF patients taking dabigatran, rivaroxaban, warfarin or AAs (including aspirin, clopidogrel or ticlopidine), respectively, from June 1, 2012 to December 31, 2013. Propensity-score weighting was used to balance covariates across study groups. Patients were followed until the first occurrence of any bleeding outcome or the end of the study. The CHA2DS2-VASc scores were 4.1±1.6, 4.1±1.6, 3.3±1.8 and 2.4±1.6 for the dabigatran, rivaroxaban, warfarin, and AA groups, respectively. There were 5,822 (88.2%) and 164 (5.2%) patients taking low dose dabigatran and rivaroxaban, respectively. Hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or warfarin versus AA were: intracranial hemorrhage, 0.36 (0.23-0.57;PP=0.0037) and 1.34 (0.89-2.02;P=0.1664); gastrointestinal bleeding, 0.44 (0.32-0.59;PP=0.0189); and all hospitalized major bleeding, 0.41 (0.32-0.53;PP=0.0644) and 0.90 (0.70-1.16;P=0.4130) after adjustment. The risk reduction of all major bleeding for dabigatran versus AA persisted on subgroup analysis. In conclusion, we observed that dabiagtran was associated with a lower risk of all major bleeding in Asians with NVAF, whereas rivaroxaban had a similar risk of all major bleeding compared with antiplatelet agents after adjustment of comorbidities.

Pregnancy in women with type 1 diabetes is associated with poor maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, the risk of these outcomes has never been evaluated in an Asian national population. In this work, we report the maternal and fetal outcomes of pregnant women with type 1 diabetes in Taiwan. A total of 2,350,339 pregnancy records created between 2001 and 2012 were obtained from the National Health Insurance database and analyzed. Here, 630 pregnancy records were identified in women having type 1 diabetes. Compared with pregnant women without type 1 diabetes, pregnant women with the disease showed increased risk of multiple adverse outcomes, including preeclampsia, eclampsia, cesarean delivery, adult respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary edema, sepsis, chorioamnionitis, pregnancy-related hypertension, puerperal cerebrovascular disorders, acute renal failure, and shock. Fetuses of type 1 diabetic mothers were at increased risk of stillbirth, premature birth, large for gestational age, low birth weight, and low Apgar score. Of the studied endpoints, only preeclampsia showed an improvement in the late period (2011-2012) when compared with the early period (2001-2010). These findings reveal that pregnant women with type 1 diabetes are at significantly increased risk of developing many adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Therefore, pregnancy outcomes in women with type 1 diabetes should be improved.

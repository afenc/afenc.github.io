BACKGROUND:
Data on a large patient population regarding very long-term outcomes after bare metal stent (BMS) implantation in diabetic patients are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the very long-term (8-17 years) clinical and 6-month angiographic outcomes of BMS implantations in patients with and without type 2 diabetes.

METHODS AND RESULTS:
A total of 2391 patients (579 with and 1812 without diabetes) who received BMS implantations between November 1995 and May 2004 were enrolled from the Cardiovascular Atherosclerosis and Percutaneous TrAnsluminal INterventions (CAPTAIN) registry into this study. During a mean follow-up period of 152Â±53months, the diabetic patients had higher rates of all-cause mortality (28% vs. 15%, p< 0.001), re-infarction (6% vs. 5%, p=0.284), target lesion revascularization (13% vs. 10%, p=0.049), and a lower cardiovascular event-free survival rate (42% vs. 56%, p< 0.001) compared to the patients without diabetes. The diabetic patients also had a higher restenosis rate (26% vs. 18%, p< 0.001) at 6-month angiographic follow-up. The multivariate analysis of risk factors for cardiac event-free survival included age (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.011; p=0.001), hypertension (HR: 1.168; p=0.011), diabetes mellitus (HR: 1.353; p<0.001), pre-existing coronary artery disease (HR: 1.341; p<0.001), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (HR: 0.992; p=0.002) (Table 7). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant difference in cardiovascular event-free survival rate between the two groups (p<0.001).

CONCLUSION:
The clinical and angiographic outcomes of diabetic patients with BMS implantations were worse than those of patients without diabetes after a very long-term follow-up period.
